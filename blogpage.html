                        <h4><p>I'm sure when you hear "The Caribbean" what comes to mind is tall palm trees and beaches but simply put, VACATION. A lot of people when asked destinations
                            for vacation say The Caribbean or start to mention countries like The Bahamas,Jamaica,Trinidad and Tobago which are all still carribean countries. All these 
                            countries have so much in common but that which stands out is the sea and the long beaches beacuse The Caribbean is a region of the Americas that consists
                            of the Caribbean sea, it's islands and surrounding coasts.    
                        </p></h4>
                        <br>

                        <h4><p>But really,what makes The Caribbean a perfect site for vacation apart from it's seas and beaches which is the only thing people think it has to offer,well,
                            there a few things that makes it on of the chief vacation hotspots.
                        </p></h4>
                        <br>

                        <h4><p>The Caribbean culture is one of the most diverse culture there is because it's a blend of the African, Amerindian, India and European traditions because 
                            of the migration of different people from each corner of the world into it's states giving it diversity in food, music, and fashion. I mean what else could
                            you ask for from a vacation place that allows you to experience lifetsyles of people from different cultures in one visit and let's not forget about the 
                            music or should I say Reggae which is a fast rising genre having originated from Jamaica in the late 60s.
                        </p></h4>
                        <br>

                        <h4><p>The festivals. Many people after visiting a caribbean country go hysterical about their festivals and I don't really blame them cause OMG it's a life 
                            changing experience because it incorporates the fine arts, street theatre, artistic and musical organisation and spectacle and fantasy. It's like a ceremony
                            of colors, art and music in it's purest form. All I can say is "Vivo para la cultura caribeña".
